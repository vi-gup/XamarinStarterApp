# XamarinStarterApp
A Xamarin forms application, showcasing the capabilities of the platform. The project contains Android and Windows UWP apps. Other supported apps like iOS can also be added if required. More than 95% code is shared across apps.

Xamarin is a great platform for building cross-platform mobile apps, but still many developers hesitate to work on Xamarin, especially because there are different ways to develop mobile apps with Xamarin which somewhat confuses them. I want to help those developers by providing them a simple boilerplate code to get started.

## Project Requirements
To successfully build and run this project, following tools and technologies are required:

* Visual Studio 2015 with Update 3
* Xamarin version 4.2

## Contributing
The purpose of this repository is to help mobile app developers getting started quickly and easily. I will be grateful for contribution in terms of bug fixing, enhancements and feature suggestions.
